# Content-based-recommendation-system
## Overview

This project is a Content-Based Cosmetics Recommendation System that suggests beauty products based on ingredient analysis. The system utilizes t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for ingredient visualization and Bokeh plots to present interactive data visualizations.

## Features

**Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends products based on ingredient similarity.

**Ingredient Visualization:** Uses t-SNE to project high-dimensional ingredient data into a 2D space.

**Interactive Visualizations:** Built with Bokeh for dynamic and insightful visual representations.

**Data Processing & Analysis:** Utilizes Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data handling and machine learning.

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning & t-SNE)

Bokeh (Interactive Visualization)
